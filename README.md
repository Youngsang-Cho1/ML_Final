# 🎵 Multimodal Music Discovery Engine
**NYU CSCI-UA 473: Fundamentals of Machine Learning (Final Project)**

---

## 📖 Project Objective
A high-fidelity music recommendation engine that focuses on **Acoustic Consistency**. We deliberately avoid black-box libraries, implementing core ML algorithms (Manual PCA, Manual K-Means++) from scratch in `NumPy` to demonstrate a deep understanding of vector space models and multimodal fusion.

### The "Skip" Problem
Traditional systems rely on broad genre tags or popularity. We solve this by creating a **mathematical "ear"** for sound, ensuring that recommendations are acoustically aligned with the seed song's timbre, texture, and energy.

## 🧠 Core Architecture: Hybrid Retrieval
We fuse two distinct modalities using a weighted distance ensemble:

### 1. Distance Metric
`Score = MSE(Metadata_Dist) + λ × (1 − Cosine_Similarity(Audio_Embeddings))`

*   **Metadata (8D):** High-level vibes (Danceability, Energy, etc.). MSE captures absolute intensity differences.
*   **Audio Embedding (56D):** Raw MFCC, Chroma, and Spectral features. Cosine Similarity captures the *direction* of the acoustic signature, overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

### 2. Preventing "Cosine Collapse"
Raw Librosa features vary wildly in scale (MFCC_0: -300, ZCR: 0.05). If unscaled, the largest dimensions dominate the vector angle, making all songs look identical. 
**Our Solution:** We enforce **Z-score Standardization (Zero Mean, Unit Variance)** across the entire 13k+ song dataset. This ensures every acoustic property has an equal voice, resulting in a balanced similarity space.

## ⚖️ λ-Tuning & Evaluation (Proven Merit)
We don't guess our parameters. We tune them via a **Same-Artist vs Random-Pair Discrimination Sweep**.

### Results (on 13,162 unique tracks)
| Variant | Pass Rate (Discrimination Accuracy) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Random Baseline | 50.0% |
| Metadata-only | 76.7% |
| Audio-only | 76.0% |
| **Hybrid (λ=0.1)** | **83.3%** ✅ |

*   **Pass Rate:** The probability that a song from the same artist is ranked closer than a completely random song.
*   **Chosen λ = 0.1:** Maximizes the engine's ability to recognize consistent production styles and vocal timbres.

## 🚀 Key Features & Interactive UI
*   **🎧 Seed Song Tab:** Discover similarity with premium visualizations.
*   **🔍 Analyze Any Song:** Zero-text inference. Download any YouTube URL, extract its 56D DNA, and find its matches in our 13k database.
*   **🎚️ Live λ Slider:** Side-by-side control. Shift from "Metadata-focused" (Balanced) to "Sound-focused" (Pure Audio) in real-time.
*   **📼 Global Music Player:** YouTube-style persistent player with a unified queue. Starts with the seed song and flows seamlessly into recommendations.
*   **📊 3D PCA Discovery:** Explore the 13,162-song vector space in interactive 3D, projected via our manual SVD implementation.
